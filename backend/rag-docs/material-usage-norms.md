# Material Usage Norms

## Standard Usage Patterns

### Material Request Frequency
- Material requests should align with project progress milestones
- Requests without corresponding DPR progress indicate potential:
  - Over-ordering
  - Misallocation
  - Planning gaps

### Usage Thresholds
- Material usage > 25% above rolling 7-day average triggers anomaly alert
- This threshold accounts for:
  - Normal project phase transitions
  - Seasonal variations
  - Legitimate bulk requirements

### Approval Workflow
- Standard approval time: 24-48 hours
- Delays > 48 hours impact:
  - Construction timeline
  - Worker productivity
  - Project costs

## Anomaly Indicators

### Excessive Usage
- Usage > 30% above average without milestone justification
- Pattern: Multiple requests in short timeframe
- Impact: Budget overrun, potential waste

### Request-Progress Mismatch
- Material requests without corresponding task completion
- Indicates: Planning disconnect or premature ordering
- Risk: Material spoilage, storage costs, budget waste

### Approval Delays
- Pending approvals > 2 requests
- Causes: Manager unavailability, workflow bottlenecks
- Impact: Work stoppage, timeline delays

## Recommended Actions
- For usage anomalies: Verify against project milestones and DPR progress
- For approval delays: Escalate to project manager, implement backup approval process
- For pattern anomalies: Review project planning and material allocation strategy
