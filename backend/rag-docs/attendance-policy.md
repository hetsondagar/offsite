# Attendance Policy

## Check-in Requirements
- All site engineers and workers must check in daily at the project site
- Check-in must occur within the designated work hours
- Location tracking is mandatory for verification

## Anomaly Detection Criteria

### Repeated Identical Check-in Times
- Same timestamp across multiple days indicates potential time manipulation
- Expected: Natural variation of ±15 minutes
- Action: Investigate if pattern persists > 3 days

### GPS Location Patterns
- Same coordinates repeatedly may indicate:
  - Location spoofing
  - Device malfunction
  - Unauthorized remote check-in
- Expected: Minor variations due to GPS accuracy (±10 meters)
- Action: Verify physical presence if coordinates identical > 5 consecutive days

### Attendance Variance
- Daily attendance should not vary > 30% from weekly average
- Sudden drops may indicate:
  - Workforce issues
  - Site access problems
  - Communication breakdown
- Action: Investigate if variance > 30% for > 2 consecutive days

## Business Impact
- Low attendance directly correlates with project delays
- Each 10% drop in attendance ≈ 1-2 day delay per week
- Consistent attendance issues require immediate management intervention
